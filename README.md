# NLP With Hotel Review

I completed this project demonstrating Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I reviewed data about hotel reviews. Part 1 of the project, I primarily focused on data cleaning and EDA. In the second part of the project, I utilized several machine learning models to look into the sentiment behind the reviews. Since the spreadsheets that contains the data was too large, I'm not able to post them in this repository.
